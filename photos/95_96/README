This directory contains pictures of the Fellowship over the years.  Other
than pictures of leadership teams (which are in the leadership directory, 
then organized by the year they were on exec), the pictures are organized 
into directories by the year they were taken.

For example, the picture SCFhug.html (which is of Rishi Goyal '95 and Erik 
Hom '95 hugging) was taken during the academic year 1994-1995;  so it is
stored in the directory 94_94/ .

And, marah.jpg, the picture of Marah Fortson, SCF President 1995, is 
stored in the directory leaders/95exec/ .
