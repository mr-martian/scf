Fall Retreat      September 29 - October 1
------------
This year's fall retreat will be held the last weekend of the month at Camp
Hebron.  The topic of the weekend will be "Learning How to Listen to God" and
our truly incredible speaker will be Karen Wellser.  More information
including costs and transportation will be coming, so keep a look out for it.

Small Groups
------------
Nearly all small groups have met by now and should have contacted you about
possibly attending.  In case you haven't been contacted yet or can*t attend
the small group in your dorm, here is a list of small groups and their
meeting times so that you can find somewhere to study the Word and pray with
other believers. (Please note that this schedule is subject to change.
Contact the individual small group leader or Kaori x1270 if you have any
questions about meeting times.  A definite schedule will be posted
(hopefully) by next week.)

LOTS & LOTS OF PRAYER IS NEEDED
-------------------------------
        If any of you have watched the news in the past few days (I
haven't) you may have heard the story of a woman & child who were murdered
in the dressing room of a clothing store.  Apparently, the son of the man
who owns the store is really sick and managed to get into the dressing
room, rape the woman (Lisa), kill her & her child (with evidence of great
struggle), and hide the bodies. The baby's body was found a few days ago,
but Lisa's body is still missing.  The police promises not to give the
murderer the death penalty if he tells them where Lisa's body is.
         We're not sure if the woman was a Christian.  Her brother Jay is a
Christian and a good friend of Susan Bell, one the managers of Sharples
(and a strong Christian).  Susan is asking us to pray for Lisa's family
since other than the brother, the family is not Christian. Pray that Lisa's
family can forgive the man who killed Lisa & her daughter. Pray that God
will use this awful situation to bring the family to God. Pray for the
murderer, that somehow he can turn to God and ask for forgiveness.  Thanks
and God bless.                         -Sarah
