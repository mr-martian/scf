Friday Night Worship    7:30PM in ***BOND***
--------------------
This week Blue Church Pastor Jim Kutnow will be speaking on a surprise
topic concerning 1 John 2:3-9.  Come to Bond to find out just what this
topic is as well as joining us for singing, prayer, fellowship, and
refreshments.

Investigative Bible Studies
---------------------------
"..and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in His name to
all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.  _YOU_ are witnesses of these things."
Luke 24:47-48.  God has called us to be witnesses of the gospel.  A
wonderful way to do that is through an IBS. Contact Brenda at x5215.  All
you need is the faith to let the text of the Bible speak for itself.


Prayer Meetings  Bond Basement Weekdays 5:00 PM, Tuesdays 7:00PM
---------------
"Let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing..."
Hebrews 10:25. God has called us to pray together, so we in turn challenge
you to come to prayer meetings.  Talking to God should be our first
priority as a Christian.  Also, the Leadership team will be meeting on
Tuesday nights at 7:00PM to pray for and with you. Come on down and pray!

Discussion Groups
-----------------
Have you felt frustration about not knowing what the Bible really says
about the deep, everyday issues that we encounter; issues such as Biblical
perspectives on friendship, competition, and a successful life?  Well, we
want to get together to wrack our brains to think about those issues.  We
hope that those discussions will not be all-talk, feel-happy time, but a
time to bring our minds, insights, and all our lives into the light of the
word of God. Jung (x3889) and Ethan (544-5492) will be leading discussions.
Please get in touch with them about your ideas and possible topics.

Music Corner:Spotlight on Rich Mullins & Michael Card - in Concert
------------                    by Kevin Koo
This week's spotlight is on two very strong artists:  Michael Card and Rich
Mullins.  Card is, in my opinion, one of the most complete and talented
Christian musicians that ever existed.  God has given him so many gifts of
music.  Just one listen to any of his ten or so albums will have you just
rejoicing and praising the Lord.  The lyrics are that good.  His _Joy in
the Journey_ album is a "best of"  album.  I have it if anyone wants a
sample of his music.   Rich Mullins has also been a solid and popular
Christian musician.  His music borders rock, folk, pop.  Oh, he wrote the
praise song "Awesome God" and is also an artist with solid lyrics.  I
personally don't have any of his music, but I can direct you to some people
who does if you want a listen.

Rich Mullins is performing on Saturday, November 5th and Michael Card on
Sunday, November 6th. If you are interested in going contact me (Kevin Koo)
at x3783 for info on ticket cost and transportation.  (Talk to Kevin by
the morning of Monday, October 9th, for tickets.)
