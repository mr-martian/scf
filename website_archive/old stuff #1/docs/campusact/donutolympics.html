<h1>Donut Olympics!</h1>
<br>
At Large Groups, we have fun events.  Few are as much fun as this one.  With
freshly made donuts (made by whatever small group <a href=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/~emagnes1/index.html>Ethan Magness</a> 
is part of), we break up into teams.  After an opening ceremony, we have several
different competitions.  Here some pics of a few of these events.
