<pre>
	The winter retreat was held (as always) in conjunction with Bryn Mawr
and Haverford Christian Fellowships on January 27-28, at the Blue Chuch, 
right here in  Springfield, Pennsylvania.  The speakers for the weekend were
Dick and Mardi Keyes from the Boston area L'Abri.
<p>
	The weekend was a mini-conference tackling the complex questions
of a tough topic.  Talks discussed such topics as:
</pre>
<ul>
	<li> how important is gender identity?
	<li> what ought to be the hub of both men's and women's identity?
	<li> what is "male" idendity?  "female" identity?  are these of God?
	<li> what does God sya about gender roles at work and at home?
	<li> are Christianity and feminism compatible?  how?
	<li> is Paul's view of marriage misogynist?
</ul>
<br>
