<h1>"Listening to God"</h1>
<h2>SCF 1995 Fall Retreat</h2>
</center>
<pre>
	Our Fall Retreat was held this year at beautiful Camp Hebron in
central Pennsylvania.  We had a wonderful time all weekend as we had great
times of praise and worship, really fun skits, wonderful devotions, excellent
meals, and lots of free time when we hiked, played volleyball, and much more.
And, our speaker for the weekend was Swarthmore Christian Fellowship alumnus
<strong>Karen Welser '92</strong>.  
</pre>
<ul>Karen spoke on the topic <strong>"Listening to God"</strong> in four talks entitled:
	<li>Why listen to God?
	<li>Ways to Listen to God
	<li>Listening through Prayer
	<li>There's no point in listening to God, Unless you're willing to Obey Him
</ul>

	<li>There's always lots of <a href="../../pics/95_96/flrtrt2.jpg">hugging</a> on retreats - check out Marah Fortson '97 and Brenda Arellano '97.
	<li>Our big hike takes us to the <a href="../../pics/95_96/flrtrt95cliff.jpg">top of a mountain</a>.  It's so pretty, but hang on, the picture is a little big.
	<li>Saturdaynight's dinner was cooked outdoors over an open flame.
