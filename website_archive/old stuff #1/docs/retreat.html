<h1>Swarthmore Christian Fellowship Retreats</h1>
</center>
<pre>
	The Fellowship generally goes on two retreats in an academic school
year - one early each semester.  This page hopes to keep a record of those
retreats by year, with pictures and summaries of the talks that were given.
For now, information is only available on a few retreats, but be on the look
out for more.
