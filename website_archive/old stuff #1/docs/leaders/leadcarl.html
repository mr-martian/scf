        Hey what's up???  My name is Carl Erik Heiberg and I am currently
serving on the SCF Leadership Team as Administrative Coordinator.  My duties
include:
<ul>
<li> Keeping the Fellowship Directory updated and complete.
<li> Making sure the Fellowship is informed about all upcoming events, 
 and, as part of that, seeing that <a href="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/ethan/cgi-bin/scf/test.pl">the FLASH</a>, our Fellowship newsletter,
 is sent our weekly.
<li> Taking minutes at Exec. Team meetings and makes sure that all matters
 involving our Fellowship are discussed at these meetings.
<li> Serving as SCF's treasurer.  That means, relating the Fellowship's
 monetary needs to the Budget Committee, keeping the Fellowship bank 
 records, and managing other expenses such as the purchase of the songs'
 copyright, bills for camp, etc.
<li> Making sure that details such as rides to conferences and reserving 
 space for events are all taken care of.
<li> Miscellanous other stuff.
</ul>
<br>
I know this all sounds very exciting, but there are a lot of behind the scenes
kind of things needed to make the Fellowship run, and that's basically what my
job as administrative coordinator entails.
<p>
I'm a senior at Swarthmore now, majoring in Economics, and if it gets approved,
Chinese.  I spend my free time doing different things around campus, but for
more information, be sure to check out <a href=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/~heiberg>my own personal web page</a>.

If you'd like to contact me for any reason, feel free to do so.  I can be
reached by email at <a href="mailto:cheiber1@cc.swarthmore.edu">cheiber1@cc.swarthmore.edu</a> or
by phone at (610) 690-3870.
