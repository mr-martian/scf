	Hello!  A Small Group Coordinator is a member of the Exec Team and 
is in charge of organizing Small Group Bible Studies on campus.  There are 
currently eight Small Groups, one especially for Frosh and one for men, but 
otherwise are based in Dorms.  See below for the schedule of the Groups.  
But more than organizing, a Small Group Coordinator is given responsibility 
to seek out what God is requiring of our Small Groups.   
</pre>
<ul><strong><em><pre>"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you
   teach and admonish one another with all wisdom,
   and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual
   songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.  And
   whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it
   all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks
   to God the Father through Him."  
				Colossians--3:16-17
</strong></em></pre>
</ul>
<pre>
      God will not allow any plan truly made in his name to fail.  He calls
us to gather IN HIS NAME so that we can soak in the Word of Christ and help
each other in our spiritual walks with the Lord. 

      I have been blessed numerous times as a Small Group member, leader, and 
Coordinator.   Steadily God's Word and love has challenged me to strengthen 
my relationships with people and accomplish his will for me as a servant in 
the Fellowship.
