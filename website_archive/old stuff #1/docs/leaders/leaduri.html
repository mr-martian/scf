Hi! My name is Uri Ko, and I'm the Prayer Coordinator for the Fellowship
this semester.
My job as a prayer coordinator is to work with the rest of the executive
team and the members of the fellowship to help in the growth of our prayer
life, as individuals and also as a body.

A big part of our vision for the semester is establishing PRAYER as a
relational core for the growth of our intimacy with God and intimacy with
each other.

<ol>With this purpose in mind, our specific goals are:
<li> To encourage each other to pray daily, individually--in other words,
 for each member of the fellowship to have a great communication with
 God through personal prayer life,
<li> To establish prayer partnerships, either within small group Bible
 studies or within specific dorms, oras discipleship between an
 upper-classman and an under-classman, and
<li> To increase the attendance at daily all-campus prayer meetings.
</ol>

The daily all-campus prayer meetings are:
<strong>Monday - Friday  5-6 p.m.</strong> in the fellowship room in the basement of Bond.
Also, to pray specifically for the fellowship and our work on campus,
prayer meetings are being held:
<strong>Monday - Friday  8-9 a.m.</strong> in the upstairs big room in Bond.
<strong>Wednesday 8-9 a.m.</strong> is a special one where all members of the exec team will
be there to pray with you.

To encourage personal time of daily prayer for each member, and to obey
God's call for us to pray for one another, a weekly prayer letter is sent
to the members of the fellowship via e-mail, every Monday. If you do not
receive this and would like to, e-mail or call me and you will be on the
mailing list. If you have a <strong>prayer request</strong> that you would like the
fellowship to pray for, please send it to me via <a href=mailto:uko1@cc.swarthmore.edu>e-mail</a>. It will go on the
weekly prayer letter.

If you have any concerns or questions or if you just want to talk about
prayer, or anything in general,  don't hesitate to contact me. "We have
peace with God, in our Lord Jesus Christ."

        And what does the Lord require of you?
To act justly and to love mercy
        and to walk humbly with your God."      Micah 6:8
