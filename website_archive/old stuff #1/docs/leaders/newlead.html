The leadership teams at SCF serve for one year periods following the calendar
year.  The team is selected through nominations from active SCF seniors and 
then approval by the Fellowship.  The following is the letter sent out by
Eric Ellingson to the Fellowship mailing list announcing the new leadership
team.</font><br>

        Hello Fellowship, This is Eric Ellingson here, writing on behalf of
the senior selection committee (listed below).  We, along with Swat's
InterVarsity staff, have been meeting in past few weeks to discuss the
nominations we received for the next leadership team for the Christian
Fellowship.
        Below is our proposed team, along with a few words of explanation.
We apologize for the email format, as opposed to our usual presentation at a
Large Group, but we felt we should get the information out as soon as
possible to allow the new team's planning to begin.  I invite you all to
read it over, and to think about whether you have concerns about the people
selected or the new roles chosen.  Please contact any member of the senior
selection committee with thoughts or concerns you might have.
        On December 15, we will be having Large Group (this Friday is the
SWAT testimonial service), at which a lot of this will be discussed.  On
the 15th, we hope to have _ALL_ of you attend, whether you normally come to
Large Group (or any other SCF events) or not.  This will be an opportunity
to talk with the new leadership team about what you feel like SCF should be
doing in the next year.  What would better fulfill your needs?  What has
been good?  What needs to be changed?  What would help your growth?  We
(the seniors and the proposed new leadership team) feel that it is very
important FOR EVERY ONE OF YOU to have your voice heard.  Regardless of your
relationship to the fellowship, please come charge the new team with your
concerns for this next year.  We will also be having a "Concert of Prayer"
at this Large Group, praying for the new leadership team and the fellowship
as a whole for the upcoming year.  If you cannot be at this meeting, please
contact me (phone, email, in person), or any of the other members of the
senior selection committee, or the new leadership team with any issues you
have concerns about.
_________________________________________________________________________
                **Proposed SCF leadership team for 1996**
        Marah Fortson as President and Large Group Coordinator
        Kevin Koo as Administrative Coordinator and New Student Outreach
        Vanya Tepavcevic as Prayer Coordinator and Community Events
        Byron Holz as Small Group Coordinator and Evangelism

These people have all been notified, and accepted the nominations.
_________________________________________________________________________

As some of you may know, the leadership team has been composed of seven
people in the past few years.  We (the seniors) felt that having a smaller
team would facilitate decision making, and encourage a change of focus from the
team being action oriented (as in the past) to its being more focused on
planning, shepherding, and getting other members involved.  We realize that
this will also require a higher level of commitment from the individual
members of the fellowship to involvement in SCF's continued growth.

Again, PLEASE give us your thoughts on this team, and on what the
fellowship should be doing over the next year - YOUR voice will make a
difference.  I also hope to see you all at the Large Group on December
15th, where you will have the chance to give your charge to the new team
directly, as well as to pray for them and the fellowship.

Thanks,
        The Senior Selection team:
