	Hey there!! I'm Young and I'm the new kid on the block.  Over the
past summer, I met these wild and crazy students from this school who wanted
to replace me just because I had broken my foot playing volleyball.  But as
you can see from my picture, who want to replace this smiling face??  Well,
I'm now an intern at this wonderful school (although I did graduate from 
another quaker school up the Blue Route) and the Lord is really blessing both
parties.  This year, my goal is to get to know and be known here at 
Swarthmore College.  If you want to have lunch or dinner, or just hang out,
don't hesitate to <a href=mailto:ykchoi@aol.com>call</a>!!
	By the way, I am sort of running a contest.  I am issuing a challenge
to all students to come up with an original joke concerning my name -- <strong>Young</strong>,
that is.  If you can think of something and I think it's funny, you will win
a trip down North Chester Road to a quaint little apartment and dinner for 
two, you and me.  So.. I'm waiting to here your inventive remarks...
	Take care and see ya around.
