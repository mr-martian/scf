	Hi friendly Web-users! My name is Nina Santos and I am currently
sophomore Engineering Major. Serving on the SCF Leadership Team as New
Student Outreach Coordinator, my main duties are to one, let the incoming
first years know about the fellowship and what we do, get them involved in
fellowship activities, and three, make their transition into Swat life
easier. I also coordinate fun and snazzy activities that the fellowship can
do together - such as bowling and picnics.  As a servant to God, my hope
for the fellowship is that we not just involve interested first years with
fellowship activities, but to really provide opportunities and support for
the deepening of their faith as well as our own.

	The Christian Fellowship is hosting a Fresman Banquet this coming 
weekend (Saturday, November 11).  If you're a freshman at Swarthmore, you're
already invited!  It will be before the Fall Formal, and will be an evening
of fine dining with <strong>great food</strong>, first class service, and beautiful music.
If you're coming, I need to know asap so that I can make sure that there's 
enough space for you.  <a href=mailto:csantos1@cc.swarthmore.edu>Email</a> me and I'll be happy to reserve you a table.
