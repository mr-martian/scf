Hi,  my name is Craig Snoeyink, and I am the large group coordinator for
our Christian Fellowship.  Most of my duties relate to organizing our
Friday Night Worships (getting speakers,  being in charge of the worship
team,  doing announcements, etc.)

As part of making sure the Large Groups go smoothly, I have to
reserve a place to worship.  These are the meeting places,
scripture passage, and talk subjects for the rest of this semester:

11-3-95         Mephistos       1 John 2:15-17  Love God, not the World
11-10-95        Bond            1 John 3:
11-17-95        Mephistos       1 John 3:
12-1-95         Bond
12-8-95         Haverford
12-15-95        Bond                            Concert of Prayer

All dates have a start time of 7:30 PM (DON'T BE LATE!!! :) )

If you have any comments,  concerns,  or even ideas for a good speaker,
feel free to email me at:  <a href="mailto:csnoeyi1@cc.swarthmore.edu">csnoeyi1@cc.swarthmore.edu</a>
or phone:       (610)690-3454


For the rest of my time I am busy with Engineering,  Football,  and leading
the All men's bible study on Sunday nights.

For those who are interested,  I have <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/~snoeyink/index.html">my own web page</a> that
you can check out.  It isn't much to look at, but it is mine.
