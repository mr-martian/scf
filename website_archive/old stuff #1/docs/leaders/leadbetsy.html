        Hi, I'm Betsy.  I'm taking a year off college to work with the 
Christian Fellowship and live in Swarthmore with my husband :).  I have many
different responsibilites this semester such as leading Willets Small Group
Bible Study and serving on the Leadership Team.  My main goal is to learn more
about campus ministry through the ministries of SCF, and to be available to 
help when I am needed.
 	I also want to make myself available to anyone who needs to talk to
someone about questions of faith, living according to God's will, or 
anything you're struggling with. I'm not a student, so I have plenty of time 
to talk!  Just call me at (610)544-5492 or send e-mail to 
<a href=mailt:bmagness@forum.swarthmore.edu>bmagness@forum.swarthmore.edu.</a>

	"Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.  Every good
	endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming 
	down from the Father of lights with whom there is no 
	variation or shadow due to change."	
					      James 1:16-17
