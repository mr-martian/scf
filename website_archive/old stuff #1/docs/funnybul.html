The following are actual announcements taken from church bulletins.  
We are not responsible for their content in any way.  They are pretty
funny though.  Enjoy!


   1.  This afternoon there will be a meeting in the south and north
       ends of the church.  Children will be baptized at both ends.

   2.  Tuesday at 4 p.m. there will be an ice cream social.  All
       ladies giving milk, please come early.

   3.  Wednesday the Ladies Liturgy Society will meet.  Mrs. Johnson
       will sing, "Put Me In My Little Bed," accompanied by the
       pastor.

   4.  Thursday at 5 p.m. there will be a meeting of the Little
       Mothers Club.  All those wishing to become little mothers,

   5.  This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Johnson to come
       forward and lay an egg on the altar.

   6.  The service will close with "Little Drops of Water."  One of
       the ladies will start quietly and the rest of the congregation
       will join in.

   7.  On Sunday, a special collection will be taken to defray the
       expense of the new carpet.  All those wishing to do something
       on the new carpet, come forward and get a piece of paper.

       and they may be seen in the church basement on Friday
       afternoon.

       basement.  Music will follow.

       Belser.
