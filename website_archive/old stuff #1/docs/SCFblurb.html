<h1>What Is The SCF?</h1>
</center>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<hr>
	The Swarthmore Christian Fellowsh (SCF) is a non-denominational
community of students who follow Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
We Believe that Jesus is the son of God and in the Divine inspiration 
and authority of the Bible;  we seek to share the Good News of Jesus 
Christ with the campus.  We are an officially chartered student
organization of Swarthmore College.  We have placed our <a href=SCFcharter.html>official charter</a>
online so that you can read it if you wish.<p>

	The entire Fellowship meets in Bond on Friday evenings at 7:30 p.m.
All are welcome to attend, regardless of their own religious beliefs.
In addition to singing and prayer, Fellowship meetings sometimes feature
guest speakers who discuss various issues relating to the Christian faith.
The meetings can also follow a more informal format, including
sharing experiences, discussing issues, and doing fun activites.  Other 
all-fellowship activities include <a href="retreat.html">retreats</a> each 
semester, and <a href="SCFcamppage.html">Chapter Camp</a> after exams 
every year.<p>

	Smaller groups gather by dorm during the week, taking the time
out from academics to study the Bible.  If you are interested, a  
<a href="SGsched.html">schedule</a> of all the small groups on campus
is available.<p>

	SCF also schedules daily <a href="prayer.html">prayer</a> meetings 
which meet in the SCF room in the basement of Bond, Monday through Friday
at 8:00 am and again at 5:00 p.m.<p>

	Students who want to find out more about Jesus Christ may want
to join an Investigative Bible Study (IBS) to examine and discuss
the Scriptures.  In order to get involved in an IBS, please contact our
Evangelism Coordinator, <a href="mailto:mpark1@cc.swarthmore.edu">Michelle Park
</a>.<p>
	The Fellowship sponsors several all-college events throughout the
year, including the Ice Cream Social and the Easter Sunrise Service, and
hosts several all-campus speakers.<p>

	SCF is affiliated with <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/iv/">
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship</a>, a national organization of college, 
university, and nursing school students.<p>
