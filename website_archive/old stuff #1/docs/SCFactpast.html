<title>Past Activities of SCF</title>
<h1>Stuff We've Done</h1>
<pre>
	This is essentially a picture book of stuff that the SCF
	has done.  We hope that you enjoy it.  Included with each
	set of pictures is an explanation of what we did and a 
	few comments from the people who participated.  As with 
	the rest of this page, we are stll under construction so 
	there may be nothing here and what there is may not fit 
	this description.  Enjoy these pictures, we certainly 
	enjoyed making them.
