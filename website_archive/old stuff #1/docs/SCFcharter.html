<h1>Swarthmore Christian Fellowship Charter</h1>
<h5>Last revised:	April, 1995 by Carl Heiberg '96</h5>
<br>
<hr>
<strong>I. Name of Organization:</strong>  Swarthmore Christian 
Fellowship<br>
<br>
<strong>II. Purpose/Goals:</strong>
	Swarthmore Christian Fellowship is a community of students who 
commit to follow Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  They welcome
all interested in learning more about Jesus Christ and the Bible.  The 
Fellowship believes that Jesus is the son of God and in the Divine 
inspiration and authority of the Bible; they seek to share the Good News 
of Jesus Christ with the campus.<br>
<br>
<strong>III. Practice:</strong>
<ul>
<li> LARGE GROUP: The entire Fellowship meets in Bond on Friday at 7:30 
p.m.   In addition to singing and prayer, Fellowship meetings sometimes 
feature guest speakers who discuss various issues relating to the 
Christian faith.  The meetings can follow a more informal format, 
including sharing experiences, discussing issues, and doing fun 
activities.  

<li>SMALL GROUPS:  Smaller groups gather in dorms during the week, taking 
the time out from academics to study the Bible.  	

<li> PRAYER MEETINGS: SCF schedules daily all-campus prayer meetings 
(usually Bond Basement) and prayer meetings in dorms (student's rooms).	

<li> INVESTIGATIVE BIBLE STUDIES:  Students who want to find out more 
about Jesus Christ may want to join an Investigative Bible Study group to 
examine and discuss the Scriptures. 

<li> ALL CAMPUS: The Fellowship sponsors several all-college events 
throughout the year, including the Ice Cream Social and the Easter 
Sunrise Service, and hosts several all-campus speakers.  We also have a 
small but growing library of literature relating to the Christian Faith 
open for use by the college community in the Community Resource Center 
(Parrish 2nd).  

<li> COMMUNICATION/ PUBLICITY:  SCF uses electronic mail to send a weekly 
newsletter to all who want to receive information regarding SCF 
activities and other SCF concerns.  SCF activities and other information 
concerning the organization are posted on the Swarthmore Christian 
Fellowship bulletin board located at the east end of Parrish (south 
wall).
</ul>
<strong>IV. Constituents: </strong>
	Everyone is welcome to attend our meetings, receive the weekly 
newsletter and be on our mailing lists (voice mail, campus mail, 
electronic mail) regardless of sex, race, color, age, religious 
background or personal beliefs, national origin, sexual preference or 
handicap.  All are especially welcome to attend Large Group and other 
all-campus events. Swarthmore Christian Fellowship presently has about 50 
active members, and over 120 Swarthmore students are on our mailing list.
<br>
<br>	 
<strong>V. Leadership:</strong>
	Decisions will be made by the team of leaders nominated by the entire 
fellowship and selected by the graduating seniors.   
<br>
<pre>
The current (Spring 1997 to Fall 1997) leadership team:
	Michelle Park		President & Evangelism Coordinator
	Craig Shockley  	Administrative & Community (NSO) Coordinator
	Byron Holz		Friday Night Worship Coordinator and Campus Liason
	Shane Steiner		Paryer & Small Group Coordinator
</pre>
<br>
<strong>VI. Budget:</strong>
SCF expenses are expected to be $150 to $200 per month from 
transportation, refreshments for the Large Group Meeting and some 
all-campus events, scholarships to retreats and conferences, bibles, and 
other books for the library.<br>
<br>
<strong>VII. Role:</strong>
	SCF is affiliated with Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, a national, 
inter-denominational organization which is part of the International 
Fellowship of Evangelical Students.  The Fellowship is not associated with any Christian denomination.  Although there are other Christian 
organizations on campus, the aforementioned beliefs listed under Part I 
(Purpose/Goals) make us unique.  A faith rooted in the foundational 
beliefs regarding the Bible and Jesus and sharing the Good News with the 
campus are are essential to many members of the college community who 
become involved in Swarthmore Christian Fellowship.
