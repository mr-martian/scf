    <p><h1>WHO WE ARE</h1></p>
    <p>
      Welcome to Swarthmore Christian Fellowship. We are an evangelical, multi-denominational undergraduate campus ministry. We invite you to come learn with us about Christianity and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the campus.
    </p>

    <a id="sofaith"></a>
    <p><h1>STATEMENT OF FAITH</h1></p>
    <p>
      We believe in:<br/>
      <br/>
      The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things,<br/>
      existing eternally in three persons-<br/>
      Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - full of love and glory.<br/>
      <br/>
      The unique divine inspiration,<br/>
      entire trustworthiness<br/>
      and supreme authority of the Bible.<br/>
      <br/>
      The value and dignity of all people:<br/>
      created in God's image to live in love and holiness,<br/>
      but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt,<br/>
      and justly subject to God's wrath.<br/>
      <br/>
      Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine,<br/>
      who lived as a perfect example,<br/>
      who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place,<br/>
      and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.<br/>
      <br/>
      Justification by God's grace to all who repent<br/>
      and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.<br/>
      <br/>
      The indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit,<br/>
      who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.<br/>
      <br/>
      The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ,<br/>
      manifest in worshipping and witnessing churches<br/>
      making disciples throughout the world.<br/>
      <br/>
      The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ,<br/>
      who will judge all people with justice and mercy,<br/>
      giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation<br/>
      but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.<br/>
      <br/>
      To God be glory forever.
