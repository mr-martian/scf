        This charter outlines the structure, goals, and guidelines of the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship (SCF).
      </p>

      <p><h2>Mission Statement</h2></p>
      <p>
        The purpose of Swarthmore Christian Fellowship is to grow as a witnessing community of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord: growing in love for God, God's Word, God's people of every ethnicity and culture and God's purposes in the world. The Fellowship believes that Jesus is the Son of God and in the Divine inspiration and authority of the Bible. We welcome all interested in learning more about Christianity and seek to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with the Campus. SCF is affiliated with Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship, a national, inter-denominational organization which is part of the International Fellowship of Evangelical Students. The Fellowship is not associated with any Christian denomination. Although there are other Christian organizations on campus, the aforementioned beliefs listed make us unique.
      </p>

      <p><h2>Meetings and Events</h2></p>
      <ul>
        <li>LARGE GROUP: The entire Fellowship meets in Kohlberg 115 on Friday at 7:30 p.m. In addition to singing and prayer, Fellowship meetings sometimes feature guest speakers who discuss various issues relating to the Christian faith. The meetings can follow a more informal format, including sharing experiences, discussing issues, and doing fun activities. </li>
        <br/>
        <li>SMALL GROUPS: Smaller groups gather once a week taking the time out from academics to study the Bible. We currently have a five small groups (Freshman/Junior Men (1), Freshman/Junior Women (2), Sophomore/Senior Men(1), Sophomore/Senior Women(1)) </li>
        <br/>
        <li>PRAYER MEETINGS: SCF schedules daily all-campus prayer meetings (usually Bond Basement) and prayer meetings in dorms (student's rooms). </li>
        <br/>
        <li>INVESTIGATIVE BIBLE STUDIES: Students who want to find out more about Jesus Christ may want to join an Investigative Bible Study group to examine and discuss the Scriptures </li>
        <br/>
        <li>ALL CAMPUS: The Fellowship sponsors several all-college events throughout the year, including the Ice Cream Social and the Easter Sunrise Service, and hosts several all-campus speakers. We also have a library of literature relating to the Christian Faith open for use by the college community in the Fellowship Room (Bond Basement). </li>
        <br/>
        <li>COMMUNICATION/PUBLICITY: SCF uses electronic mail to send a weekly newsletter to all who want to receive information regarding SCF activities and other SCF concerns. SCF activities and other information concerning the organization are posted on the Swarthmore Christian Fellowship bulletin board located at the east end of Parrish (south wall), and we sometimes make flyers that are posted campus wide. </li>
      </ul>

      <p><h2>Membership</h2></p>
      <p>
        Everyone is welcome to attend our meetings, receive the weekly newsletter and be on our mailing lists (voice mail, campus mail, electronic mail) regardless of sex, race, color, age, religious background or personal beliefs, national origin, sexual preference or handicap. All are especially welcome to attend Large Group and other all-campus events. Swarthmore Christian Fellowship presently has about 45 active members, and over 120 Swarthmore students are on our mailing list.
      </p>

      <p><h2>Organizational Structure</h2></p>
      <p>
        Decisions will be made by the team of leaders nominated by the entire fellowship and selected by the graduating seniors. Those who are selected must ascribe to the mission/purpose statement of the fellowship stated above. Incoming leadership will work with outgoing leadership and the staff worker to familiarize themselves with new positions/responsibilities. Records will be maintained by and passed down to the Adminstrative Coordinator who is a non-senior who acts as Treasurer.
      </p>

      <p><h2>Expenses</h2></p>
      <p>
        SCF expenses are expected to be between $700-$800 going towards our annual Freshman Banquet in the Fall Semester, funding for outside speakers we invite to Large Group meetings (~$1O0), for outside speakers we invite for campus talks (~$400), advertising for Large Group meetings/all campus talks/ Holy Week Activities/etc, and transportation to conferences/retreats (twice a semester). We also use this money to buy books for our library.
